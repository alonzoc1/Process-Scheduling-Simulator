Process Scheduler Simulator for CS 143B
- Alonzo Castanon

When run, program expects one line of input representing all the processes to simulate.
For each process, give the time it should arrive (eg, if you want it to start off
in the process queue, this number should be 0), and give the number of time units
required for the process to finish.

An example of 3 processes, two arriving at time 0 and one arriving at time 3:
0 4 0 2 3 1
The first process requires 4 time units to complete, the second requires 2, and the third, 1.

Output will show results of using:
- First-in-First-out
- Shortest Job First (non preemptive)
- Shortest Remaining Job First (preemptive)
- Multilevel Feedback Queue (preemptive)
